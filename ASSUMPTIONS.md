# ASSUMPTIONS

- values are integers. The app does not assume any constraint, so they could be negative or zero.
- No errors will be produced. That means, either the minimum path is produced 
or the application finishes silently.
- Each row of an encoded triangle is finished by the system line terminal. That is,
`\n` in Unix/OSX/Linux systems.
